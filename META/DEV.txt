Current development principles:

1) only store_local_db touches db models
2) stores can only READ from other stores
3) only controller_main touches views
4) models are db-ebean models
5) other models are not represented in the db. For e.g models_github
6) business logic goes in the controllers
7) shared controller logic and specialized logic goes in handlers
8) 3rd party tools go in vendors
9) models are basically data-holders maybe plus some simple logic
10) models are `smallest common denomoinator`, in the github api sense. ie
     all models can be built from the minial info in github api
11) Sync classes are long running processes, they can organize data in the background
