Maybe better to not mention the indiepocalypse, see here:

http://www.butterscotch-shenanigans.com/2015/10/indiepocalypse-more-like.html

some preliminary thoughts--

activation energy to create games, or just general sw is very low.

gamedev barriers to entry are lower than ever

unity, ue4, cryengine, etc.

photoncloud, playfab, etc.

web, consoles, desktop, mobile, etc.

industry is making big money, perhavs more than movies!

but making a living as an idie dev is still very hard

one has to do everything alone. Team is very important but people are busy, how can you afford to pay?

aaa teams are large. The human factor is their advantgae!

current solutions: kickstarters, patreons, etc.

downsides: kickstarter is mostly all or nothing. Still need to find team, pay and manage it all
patreon won't suffice for a large team

kosmos is a different solution.

Instead of approaching end users approach the indie dev community

contrubute to game projects and get your share of the revenu

its not a talent and time for favor but rather talent and time for cash

if a dev feels a game has a chance at making cash, she can consider contributing

games that do not yet seem to have a good chance will not get much contributions.

this method has many downsides:

- code has to be visible
- etc.

but so does every method. This method may be a good fit for some developpers and genres.

its like an experiment currently

I'm sure some succesful games can grow

we're dogfooding this whole project!
