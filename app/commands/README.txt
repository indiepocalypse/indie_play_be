The commands, ie the classes in thi directory that implement the interface_command
are scanned and put into an array automatically.

// TODO: a `move_creator` command (ie move creatorship to someone else)
// TODO: an `offer` command
// TODO: currently when args of commands are out of bounds (say negative percentage) no error description is returned
// TODO: integrate request, offer and merge commands
// TODO: a bug -- when opening a pull request with a request for merge the mergeability is undecideable initially. Some wait has to be put in there...
