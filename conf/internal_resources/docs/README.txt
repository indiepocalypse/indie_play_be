this is the docs folde.

.md files are used to autogenerate documentation when program starts.

Results are cached of course!

.md files should start with a number like this: 1.0_filename.md
file 1.01_ will be ordered before 1.1_ of course

the number is used to order the sections

file name used as docs main section title

sections in file start with #section_name

thats all!
